# Acute demand

## Background

Growing at a completely unsustainable rate

##  Actions - understanding

Every request contains a lot of latent information.
* How did the patient present?
* Who is the patient?  Demographics, indices of deprivation
* Who assessed the patient?
* Who requested the examination and what support did they have?
* What investigation was chosen?
* Who was involved in the justification of the study?
* Who was it reported by? ST, cons or outsourced.
* What did the examination show in the report?
* What are the resources needed - time of day and exam type are key.  A MRI at 4am is much more than a wrist plain film at 10am


## Action - data analytics

Take the fine grained data.  Develop some deeper further analytics to sit beside the iReferCDS dashboard.

This data needs to be taken in granular form and mined for insight in the light of the features of the previous paragraph.

Demography (particularly indices of depreviation and GP practice are **very** important)

LLMs can generate key insights (NX/UNHM CTPA and CTC projects)

Need centralised guidance on approval of data-sharing between trusts for QIP - there is too much friction in sharing even anoymous data.

## Action - scaling

Our approach needs to be network and nationally scalable.  Suggest a public repository of analysis scripts, and provision of help/coaching to get others able to replicate the approach.  [PenCHORD](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-implementation/research-teams/penchord/) have made a lot of material available.

The transformation would need time input from experienced Consultant Radiologists.  I have spoken to Ingrid Britton at UHNM - and we propose to work together.

We need more work on the guideline generation that is then served by iReferCDS

## Action - levers

It is essential to look at the end to end pathways.  Generate cogent robust evidence to show ED leaders that effective inaction can improve service without compromising safety.

There is advantage to all in not choking the system and in doing only that which is necessary, but doing that well.

Feed into updated national guidelines on acute pathways (NICE radiology subcommittee doesn't exist as far as we know)

Up the speed of dissemination of approved pathways, and the pace of change in general.
